================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Mission: Analyze 774 blockchain transactions across 111 unique wallets to 
identify patterns, clustering, exchange attribution, and RICO enterprise benefit.

RESULTS:
  ✓ All 5 tasks completed successfully
  ✓ 111 unique wallets identified and analyzed
  ✓ 10 wallet clusters identified (consolidating 111 wallets)
  ✓ 6 central hub wallets identified as critical infrastructure
  ✓ 453 STRONG RICO theory transactions identified
  ✓ $563M+ enterprise benefit quantified
  ✓ $1.69B treble damages potential calculated
  ✓ 101 KYC subpoenas saved through cluster consolidation

================================================================================
TASK 1: WALLET CLUSTERING
================================================================================

OUTPUT: coordination/wallet_clusters.json (15KB)
STATUS: ✓ COMPLETED

RESULTS:
  - Total Wallets Analyzed: 111
  - Clusters Identified: 10
  - Wallets Clustered: 111 (100%)
  - Singleton Wallets: 0
  - Largest Cluster Size: 37 wallets (cluster_007)

TOP 3 CLUSTERS:
  1. cluster_007: 37 wallets, 37 tx, $14.9M total value
  2. cluster_002: 13 wallets, 26 tx, $34.3M total value
  3. cluster_004: 12 wallets, 36 tx, $27.8M total value

CLUSTERING METHODOLOGY:
  - Transaction timing patterns
  - Common counterparties analysis
  - Shared exchange deposit patterns
  - Entity theory: "Same entity (likely)"

COST SAVINGS:
  - 101 duplicate KYC subpoenas eliminated
  - Lead wallet approach reduces subpoena count from 111 to 10

================================================================================
TASK 2: EXCHANGE FINGERPRINTING
================================================================================
