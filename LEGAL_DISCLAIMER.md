## 🤖 AI-ASSISTED INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

### **Simulative Investigation Framework**

This investigation employs **AI agent personas** to explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously. This methodology:

1. **Assigns specialized roles to AI agents** (e.g., "Blockchain Forensics Expert", "Legal Analyst", "Pattern Detective")

2. **Instructs agents to assume certain facts as true** within their analytical scope to:
   - Guide targeted research
   - Isolate specific variables
   - Test hypothesis validity
   - Identify evidentiary gaps

3. **Documents agent findings** which may include:
   - **Hypotheses stated as assertions** (for analytical clarity)
   - **Speculative connections** (to identify patterns)
   - **Assumed relationships** (to test network theories)
   - **Predictive statements** (to guide evidence collection)

### **⚠️ CRITICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDANCE**

**Statements in agent outputs that appear as facts may actually be:**
- Working hypotheses
- Analytical assumptions
- Speculative connections
- Research targets requiring verification

**These are NOT:**
- Established facts
- Proven allegations
- Verified evidence
- Conclusive findings

### **Purpose of This Methodology**

The simulative investigation approach allows:
- ✅ Rapid hypothesis generation and testing
- ✅ Systematic exploration of evidence patterns
- ✅ Identification of evidence gaps
- ✅ Prioritization of investigative leads
- ✅ Efficient allocation of research resources

**This does NOT create admissible evidence or proven facts.**

## 🎯 EVIDENTIARY TIERS & RELIABILITY

All evidence items are assigned tiers reflecting **investigative priority**, not proof:

| Tier | Priority | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Critical | High prosecutorial value if verified; requires immediate follow-up |
| **Tier 2** | High | Strong evidentiary potential; needs corroboration |
| **Tier 3** | Medium | Supporting evidence; useful for context |
| **Tier 4** | Low | Background information; limited direct value |
| **Tier 5** | Minimal | Tangential; included for completeness |

**Tier assignment does NOT indicate:**
- ❌ Admissibility in court
- ❌ Verification status
- ❌ Factual accuracy
- ❌ Legal sufficiency
