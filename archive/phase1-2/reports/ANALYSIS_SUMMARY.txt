PRICING CLAIMS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
URLs with pricing claims: 6 (0.22%)

Note: Very few explicit pricing claims in the $25K-$50K range were detected
in the scraped content. This may be due to:
  1. Pricing hidden behind forms/registration walls
  2. JavaScript-rendered content not captured by scraper
  3. Pricing discussed verbally in videos (not in metadata)
  4. Links leading to private consultation booking pages

Sample detected prices:
  - $19,000 (news article)
  - $85,000,000 (unrelated news)
  - Various GoFundMe campaigns ($4K-$17K range)

================================================================================
STATUS ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Success : 2,627 URLs (98.06%)
Error   :    52 URLs ( 1.94%)

Error URLs primarily:
  - Telegram links (blocked/access denied)
  - Dead/removed pages
  - Rate-limited domains

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. HIGH-RISK URL CONCENTRATION
   - 108 URLs (4.03%) scored >= 40 (high-risk threshold)
   - 16 URLs (0.60%) scored >= 50 (critical-risk threshold)
   - All top 50 URLs contain Light System mentions
   - Website platform has highest fraud indicator density (9.45%)

2. FRAUD KEYWORD PATTERNS
   - "Healing" and "energy" most prevalent (106 + 74 occurrences)
   - "Quantum" appears in 26 URLs (high-weight indicator)
   - Combination of quantum + healing + frequency = highest risk score (53)

3. LIGHT SYSTEM TRACKING
   - 128 URLs (4.78%) explicitly mention Light System/TLS
   - Primary domains: thelightsystems.com, tlsmarketplace.shop
   - Associated domains: jasonshurka.com, unifyd.tv

4. TIER CLASSIFICATION
   - 0 Tier 1 URLs (no blockchain-verified evidence in this dataset)
   - 128 Tier 2 URLs (all Light System mentions)
   - 2,551 Tier 3 URLs (general content, lower confidence)

5. PLATFORM INSIGHTS
   - YouTube is primary content distribution (53.94%)
   - Websites contain most concentrated fraud indicators
   - UNIFYD platform appears in 20% of dataset (537 URLs)
   - Telegram has minimal representation (3.51%)

6. PRICING DISCOVERY LIMITATIONS
   - Direct pricing claims ($25K-$50K) rarely in public content
   - Recommend follow-up analysis of:
     * Video transcripts (YouTube)
     * Private consultation booking flows
     * Web form submissions
     * Behind-paywall content

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. PRIORITY INVESTIGATION
   - Focus on top 50 URLs (fraud score >= 45)
   - All are Tier 2 with confirmed Light System mentions
   - Websites with "quantum healing" combinations highest priority

2. CONTENT EXTRACTION
   - Extract full text/transcripts from top 50 YouTube videos
   - Archive website pages before potential removal
   - Document pricing information behind booking forms

3. CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS
   - Map post_id to original Telegram posts
   - Connect URLs to specific claims/testimonials
   - Identify affiliate/referral networks (tlsmarketplace affiliates)

4. BLOCKCHAIN VERIFICATION LAYER
   - Archive critical evidence to immutable storage
   - Timestamp key URLs before content changes
   - Create verifiable chain-of-custody for Tier 1 classification

5. EXPAND FRAUD INDICATORS
   - Add testimonial analysis (disease reversal claims)
   - Track FDA/medical device registration status
   - Monitor pricing changes over time
   - Identify influencer network connections
